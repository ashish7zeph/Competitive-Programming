# Competitive Programming

My codes for different competitive problems. 

This is a personal repository to keep the track of the progress of my journey in the field of competitive programming !!
The more you code, the better you code !!

# IEEE Xtreme 12.0

IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems.

My experience of this 24 hour coding competition is very interesting. Coding continuously for 24 hours without getting a sleep is really not an easy task. I get to know this at the end of the competition. But the job performed during these 24 hours is the thing for happiness at the end of the competition, when your 24 hour work leads to a nice rank all over the world on the scoreboard. Well !! I was quite happy for me and my teammates to achieve country rank AIR 19 and world rank 210/4049. More than that I was happy for the problems, I coded a solution for!!

Special thanks to my teammates: [Sonali Saraswat]() and [Mansi Bhandari]()
